# WPF Testing Application

Simple WPF test application that uses an open API to get 100 posts and display their id and then switch to userId when you click on any element.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** C#, .NET, WPF

Basic WPF application with a DataAccess project and a Svc project with some unit testing. 
Using DI for everything and automapper to map from DA to model.

## Optimizations

I should find a better element or see if I can implement a custo one. Clicking once does not work, and double click is eh? 
Otherwise there is not much else to do I think.

## Lessons Learned:

Another interesting Open API. Also some WPF experience, even as basic as it is, since it's the first time I'm using it.

## Things to improve:

--better element for displaying,
--something else if I find out
